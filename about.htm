						<h3>Our Program</h3>
							<p>We start off the first semester with HTML5 and CSS3 and a foundation in general technical aspects of development, web design, databases and marketing. Second semester, we then go on to JavaScript and MySQL.  At this point we do introduce different development environments and tools. The third semester we learn PHP and dive into the marketing end with SEO, analytics, etc.  We also certify Graphic Design with Photoshop and Illustrator.  The last semester is where we go a little farther into more advanced development as well as study new emerging technologies.</p>

						<h3>Our School</h3>
							<p>What makes EITC Web Development stand out is the fact that the focus is on a hands-on, "job ready" education.  Our graduates are ready to work and will have had real industry work experience through local internships. Faculty/student ratio is 1:15. Classes involve a combination of lecture and "hands-on" experiences.</p>
